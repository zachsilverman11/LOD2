# üîç PRODUCTION DIAGNOSIS - Found Root Cause

## Test Results

### **Production Cron Test** (just ran)
```
curl https://lod2.vercel.app/api/cron/autonomous-holly
```
**Result**: HTTP 200, completed in 0.02 seconds
**Problem**: Way too fast! Should take 5-60 seconds to process leads

### **Root Cause Found** (Line 219-222 in lib/autonomous-agent.ts)
```typescript
if (!ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_AGENT) {
  console.log('[Holly Agent] ‚è∏Ô∏è  Disabled via ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_AGENT env var');
  return;
}
```

**The cron is exiting immediately because `ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_AGENT` is NOT SET in production!**

## Why This Happened

You said earlier "Those environment variables have already been added" but looking at the evidence:

1. **Cron completes in 0.02 seconds** = exiting early due to env check
2. **20 leads overdue for 12+ hours** = cron never processes them
3. **No responses to SMS replies** = webhook also checks this env var

**The environment variable was either:**
- Never actually added to Vercel production
- Added but not deployed (needs redeploy)
- Added to preview/development instead of production

## Immediate Fix Required

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel Production**

Go to: https://vercel.com/zachsilverman11/lod2/settings/environment-variables

Add these variables for **Production** environment:

```
ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_AGENT=true
DRY_RUN_MODE=false
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key from .env.local>
```

### **Step 2: Redeploy**

After adding env vars, redeploy:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
- OR: Push a small commit to trigger auto-deploy

### **Step 3: Verify Fix**

Run this command after redeploy:
```bash
curl https://lod2.vercel.app/api/cron/autonomous-holly
```

Should take 5-60 seconds (not 0.02s) and process leads.

## Why My Tests Failed

I was testing `.env.local` which works for local development but Vercel production has its own environment variables that must be set in the Vercel dashboard.

When I ran `grep ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_AGENT .env.local` it showed the variable exists locally, so I thought it was configured everywhere. **This was my mistake.**

## Next Steps After Fix

Once env vars are added and redeployed:

1. ‚úÖ Cron will process 20 overdue leads
2. ‚úÖ New leads will be contacted within 15 min
3. ‚úÖ SMS replies will get instant responses
4. ‚úÖ I'll monitor for 24 hours to confirm it stays working

Then I'll add:
- Production health check endpoint
- Daily Slack health reports
- Batch processing with timeout protection
- Better error alerting

## Verification Checklist

After you add env vars and redeploy, I will verify:

- [ ] Cron takes >5 seconds (processing leads)
- [ ] Wynne Connolly gets contacted within 15 min
- [ ] Sarah Crosman gets response to her 12h old reply
- [ ] Activity feed shows new Holly messages
- [ ] No more 0.02 second cron completions

**Let me know when you've added the env vars to Vercel production and I'll verify the fix immediately.**
