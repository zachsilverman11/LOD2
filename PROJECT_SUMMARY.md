- **Database indexes**: Optimized queries
- **Modular architecture**: Easy to extend
- **Cron jobs**: Background processing for automations

## Next Steps to Go Live

1. **Set up infrastructure**:
   - Deploy database (Vercel Postgres recommended)
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Configure custom domain

2. **Configure integrations**:
   - Create Cal.com account and event type
   - Set up Resend with domain verification
   - Get Twilio phone number
   - Create Vapi.ai assistant

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Send test webhook
   - Trigger email/SMS/voice
   - Test Cal.com booking flow
   - Verify automation rules

4. **Launch**:
   - Connect lead provider webhooks
   - Monitor initial leads
   - Adjust automation timing as needed

## Estimated Setup Time

- Infrastructure setup: 1-2 hours
- Integration configuration: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 1-2 hours
- **Total: 4-7 hours to production**

## Success Metrics to Track

1. **Conversion Rate**: % of leads that book discovery calls
2. **Response Time**: Time from lead creation to first contact
3. **Channel Effectiveness**: Which channel (Email/SMS/Voice) drives most bookings
4. **Show Rate**: % of booked calls that actually happen
5. **Cost per Booking**: Total automation cost / bookings

## Support & Maintenance

- **Cron jobs**: Run automatically (no manual intervention)
- **Data cleanup**: Automated PIPEDA compliance
- **Error monitoring**: Add Sentry for production alerts
- **Updates**: Standard npm package updates

## Cost Estimate (Monthly)

- Vercel Hosting: $0-20 (Hobby to Pro)
- Database: $0-25 (Vercel Postgres)
- Cal.com: $0 (Free tier or $12/seat)
- Resend: $0-20 (20k emails free)
- Twilio: ~$0.0079/SMS + phone rental
- Vapi.ai: ~$0.05-0.15/minute of calls

**Total**: ~$50-100/month for moderate volume (hundreds of leads)
