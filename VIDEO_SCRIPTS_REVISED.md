## Video #1: Guaranteed Approvals Certificate (2:30)

### Script for Greg or Jakub:

**[Opening - 0:00-0:15]**
*Camera on, warm smile*

"Hey! I'm Greg with Inspired Mortgage. Holly mentioned you're interested in our Guaranteed Approvals Certificate, so I wanted to jump on here and show you exactly what it is and how it works."

**[Transition to Screen Share - 0:15-0:20]**
*Share screen showing example certificate*

"Let me share my screen so you can see what one of these actually looks like..."

**[Main Content - 0:20-1:30]**

**Show Certificate on Screen:**

"So this is a Guaranteed Approvals Certificate. Think of it like a letter from us that says 'This buyer is 100% approved for their mortgage - guaranteed.'

Here's the problem it solves: You're out there looking at homes, you find one you love, but so do three other buyers. The seller has multiple offers to choose from. Who do you think they're going to pick?

*[Pause for effect]*

The buyer with a Guaranteed Approvals Certificate. Because this tells them you're the real deal - not someone who MIGHT get approved, but someone who's ALREADY approved and ready to close.

**[Click to highlight key sections of certificate]**

Here's what makes it powerful:

1. **We verify everything upfront** - Your income, credit, down payment - all checked and confirmed by us before you even make an offer.

2. **It's underwriter-reviewed** - This isn't just a pre-approval. We've had our underwriting team look at your file and give the thumbs up.

3. **Sellers love it** - In a multiple offer situation, this puts you on the same playing field as a cash buyer. Realtors know when they see this certificate, the deal is going to close.

**[Real Example - 1:30-2:00]**

I'll give you a real example: Last month, we had a client - young couple, first-time buyers - they were competing against four other offers on a townhouse in Burnaby. Three offers were higher than theirs. But they had the Certificate.

The seller picked them. Why? Because the seller knew with 100% certainty the deal would close. No financing falling through, no surprises.

That's the power of this thing.

**[Call to Action - 2:00-2:30]**

Now, here's the thing - not everyone qualifies for this. We need to verify your full situation first.

If you want to see if you qualify and how it would work for your specific purchase, let's jump on a quick 15-minute call. I'll walk you through exactly what we need, how fast we can get it done, and what it'll do for your offer strength.

**[Show Cal.com link on screen]**

Just click the booking link Holly sent you - or if you don't have it handy, it's right here on the screen:

Pick a time that works for you, and we'll get you set up.

Looking forward to chatting!

## Video #2: No Bank Penalties Program (2:30)

### Script for Greg or Jakub:

**[Opening - 0:00-0:20]**
*Camera on, confident tone*

"Hey, it's Jakub from Inspired Mortgage. Holly mentioned you asked about our No Bank Penalties Program. This is one of my favorite programs to talk about because it solves a problem that most people don't even realize they're going to have until it's too late."

**[Transition to Screen Share - 0:20-0:30]**
*Share screen showing two scenarios side-by-side*

"Let me show you what I mean..."

**[The Problem - 0:30-1:00]**

**[Show comparison of Big Bank vs Monoline Lender penalties]**

"Here's what happens to most people: They get their mortgage with one of the big banks - TD, RBC, Scotia, whatever. Everything's fine... until life happens.

Maybe 3 years in:
- You need to refinance to pull out equity for a renovation
- You get transferred for work and need to sell
- You want to consolidate some high-interest debt
- Or rates have dropped and you want a better deal

And your bank says 'Sure, you can break your mortgage... that'll be $18,000.'

**[Point to penalty calculation]**

Why so high? Because the big banks use something called IRD - Interest Rate Differential. It's designed to maximize their profit when you leave early.

**[The Solution - 1:00-1:50]**

**[Show the No Penalty guarantee on screen]**

This is where our No Bank Penalties Program comes in.

Here's how it works:

**1. We set you up with specific lenders** - These are what we call monoline lenders in Canada. Their penalty calculations are WAY more fair than the big banks. They still might use IRD, but the formula is not punitive.

**2. You get flexibility built-in** - If you ever need to break your mortgage during the term - to refinance, sell, whatever - the penalty is calculated fairly. Not those crazy big bank numbers.

**3. Here's the best part:** If you refinance with us during your term for the same or greater mortgage amount, **we pay your penalty. 100%.**

*[Let that land]*

So you're never stuck. You have total flexibility.

**[Real Example - 1:50-2:05]**

Real example: Client got a mortgage with one of our monoline lenders. Two years later, their home value shot up and they wanted to pull out $80K for a rental property down payment.

Penalty would have been $4,500. They refinanced with us for a higher amount. We covered the full $4,500. They got their $80K. Done.

If they'd been with a big bank? That penalty would've been $15,000+, and they would've had to pay it out of pocket.

**[Call to Action - 2:05-2:30]**

So here's what this means for you: You get a competitive rate, you're not locked in, and you have total flexibility to refinance if you need to.

The rate might be slightly higher than the absolute lowest out there, but the flexibility is worth way more.

**[Show Cal.com link]**

Let's hop on a quick call and I'll show you exactly which lenders qualify and what your rate would look like.

Let's get you set up with flexibility, not handcuffs.

## Video #3: Reserved Ultra-Low Rates (2:15)

### Script for Greg or Jakub:

**[Opening - 0:00-0:15]**
*Camera on, confident tone*

"Hey! Greg here from Inspired Mortgage. Holly mentioned you're interested in our Reserved Ultra-Low Rates program. This is a premium program we offer for clients who care most about getting the absolute lowest rate possible."

**[Transition to Screen Share - 0:15-0:25]**
*Share screen showing rate comparison (no specific numbers, just visual bars showing "standard" vs "bought down")*

"Let me show you what this looks like..."

**[The Opportunity - 0:25-0:50]**

**[Show rate comparison visual]**

"Here's the reality of mortgage rates: There's the rate lenders advertise, and then there's the rate you can actually get if you have leverage.

Most people don't know this, but mortgage brokers earn a commission from lenders. What we do in this program is we take part of OUR commission and use it to buy down YOUR rate.

So instead of the standard rate, you get something better. Sometimes significantly better.

**[The Catch - 0:50-1:30]**

**[Show qualification checklist on screen]**

Now, here's the thing - we don't offer this to everyone. Here's why:

When we buy down your rate, we're essentially investing our commission into your deal. So we need to make sure the deal is rock-solid and moves FAST.

**Who qualifies:**

✅ **Fully income-qualified** - T4 employees, clear income verification, no complications

✅ **Excellent credit** - You're an A+ file, straightforward approval

✅ **Fast documentation** - You get us your full application and documents within [X days] of your call with us

✅ **Streamlined process** - This needs to be a file we can push through quickly with no issues

**[Show example on screen]**

Think of this as our VIP track. If you're ready to move, have your ducks in a row, and want the absolute best rate - this is for you.

**[The Benefit - 1:30-1:50]**

**[Show rate comparison again]**

What does this mean in real numbers?

Even a 0.15% rate difference on a $600K mortgage saves you about **$55/month**. Over 5 years, that's **$3,300** in your pocket.

And we can often do better than 0.15% depending on the lender and the situation.

But you have to qualify, and you have to move fast.

**[Call to Action - 1:50-2:15]**

So here's what we should do:

Let's get on a quick 15-minute call. I'll look at your situation, tell you if you qualify for this program, and if you do, I'll show you exactly what rate we can get you.

**[Show Cal.com link]**

If it makes sense, we'll move forward. If not, we'll find the best option that fits your situation.

Book right here:

**cal.com/team/inspired-mortgage**

Or click the link Holly sent you.

Let's see if we can get you the lowest rate in the market.

## 🎬 Recording Tips Specific to Each Video

### Video #1 (Certificate):
- Have the actual certificate visible for most of the video
- Use your mouse to highlight sections as you talk about them
- The "real example" should feel conversational, not scripted
- Emphasize the emotional win (seller picked them despite lower offer)

### Video #2 (No Penalties):
- Show a clear visual comparison (Big Bank penalties are SCARY)
- The $18,000 vs $4,500 comparison should be bold on screen
- When you say "we pay your penalty," slow down and let it land
- Emphasize "flexibility" and "not locked in" multiple times

### Video #3 (Reserved Rates):
- Keep the qualification checklist visible throughout
- Don't apologize for being selective - position it as exclusive
- The "VIP track" language should sound premium, not elitist
- Be clear this isn't for everyone (scarcity creates value)
