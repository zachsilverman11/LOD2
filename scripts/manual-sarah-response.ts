  const message = `That's actually perfect timing then! Having both properties with mortgages coming due gives us a great opportunity to restructure everything strategically.

With $400k across both properties plus the buyout and debt consolidation, there's likely some significant savings we can unlock - especially if we can time everything right with your ex's buyout agreement.

Would love to walk through the numbers with you and show you what's possible. Do you have 15 min this week for a quick call? We can map out the best approach for both properties.`;
