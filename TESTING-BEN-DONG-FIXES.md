# Testing Plan for Ben Dong Fixes

## Summary of Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Fix #1: Data Repair
**Issue:** Ben Dong had `status="APPLICATION_STARTED"` but `applicationStartedAt=NULL`

**Fix Applied:**
- Set `applicationStartedAt` to call outcome timestamp (Oct 16, 2025 10:04am PT)
- Verified no other leads have this corruption

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Deduplication for Application Links
**Issue:** Ben received TWO application link messages 3 minutes apart:
- Message 1: 10:01am (from automation cron)
- Message 2: 10:04am (from call outcome submission)

**Fix Applied:**
- Added 15-minute deduplication check in `/app/api/leads/[leadId]/call-outcome/route.ts`
- Before sending app link, check if one was sent in last 15 minutes
- If yes, skip and log: "Application link already sent X minutes ago"

**Code Location:** Lines 103-120 in call-outcome/route.ts

**Test Plan:**
1. Have advisor log call outcome with `READY_FOR_APP`
2. Immediately submit another call outcome for same lead
3. **Expected:** Only 1 message sent, second one skipped with log message
4. Wait 16 minutes
5. Submit another call outcome
6. **Expected:** New message IS sent (deduplication expired)

---

### ✅ Fix #3: Contextual Post-Call Messages
**Issue:** Holly's messages were generic "Great call with Greg Williamson" instead of using call notes

**Example Bad Message (Before):**
> "Hi Ben! Great call with Greg Williamson. Ready for your application? Takes 15 mins: [link]. Questions? Just text!"

**Greg's Actual Call Notes:**
> "He has a mortgage coming up for renewal in Mid December. he is planning on doing a tear down in one year, although he has been planning this for two consecutive one years, which has led him to keep taking one year mortgages at higher rates to avoid the penalty. I pitched a variable rate with no bank penalties and that's why he converted. We will have to secure the sale in the strategy session, I recommend we do that appointment live to ensure we handle all objections"

**Example Good Message (After Fix):**
> "Hi Ben! Greg mentioned you're looking at a variable rate for your December renewal - the no bank penalties program is perfect for your 1-year teardown plan! Ready to start your application? Takes 15 mins: [link]. Questions? Just text!"

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced AI prompt to include call notes, outcome, and lead quality
- Added explicit instructions: "DO NOT use generic phrases"
- Added examples of good vs bad messages
- AI now has full context to write personalized messages

**Code Location:** Lines 123-184 in call-outcome/route.ts

**Test Scenarios:**

#### Test 1: Detailed Call Notes
**Input:**
- Advisor: Greg Williamson
- Outcome: READY_FOR_APP
- Lead Quality: hot
- Notes: "Needs $500K refinance by March 15th for home reno. Concerned about appraisal timing. Wants 5-year fixed."

**Expected Message:**
Should reference: March 15th deadline, $500K amount, home reno, appraisal concerns, 5-year fixed preference

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Mentions specific date/timeline
- ✅ Mentions specific amount
- ✅ Mentions specific purpose (home reno)
- ✅ Acknowledges concerns
- ❌ Does NOT say generic "great call"

#### Test 2: Short Call Notes
**Input:**
- Advisor: Jakub Huncik
- Outcome: READY_FOR_APP
- Lead Quality: warm
- Notes: "Looking to purchase in Surrey, pre-approved elsewhere but wants better rate"

**Expected Message:**
Should reference: Surrey location, rate shopping, pre-approval status

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Mentions location
- ✅ Mentions rate as motivation
- ✅ Acknowledges they're already pre-approved
- ❌ Does NOT say generic "great call"

#### Test 3: Minimal Notes
**Input:**
- Advisor: Greg Williamson
- Outcome: READY_FOR_APP
- Lead Quality: hot
- Notes: "Ready to proceed"

**Expected Message:**
Should still be friendly and specific, even without detailed notes. Can reference lead's original inquiry or other context.

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Warm and personal tone
- ✅ References advisor by name
- ✅ Clear call to action
- ⚠️  May be more generic due to lack of notes, but should still sound natural

#### Test 4: No Notes
**Input:**
- Advisor: Jakub Huncik
- Outcome: READY_FOR_APP
- Lead Quality: Not specified
- Notes: (empty)

**Expected Message:**
Should handle gracefully, fall back to "Based on your chat with Jakub..."

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ No errors or weird formatting
- ✅ Still sounds professional
- ✅ Still includes all required info (link, time estimate, etc.)

## Production Testing Checklist

After deployment, monitor next 5 call outcomes:

### For Each Call Outcome:
- [ ] Check Slack for duplicate messages (should be ZERO)
- [ ] Read Holly's SMS - does it reference call notes?
- [ ] Read Holly's Email - does it reference call notes?
- [ ] Ask advisor: "Does this message sound good?"
- [ ] Check Twilio logs - confirm only 1 SMS sent per outcome

### Success Metrics (After 48 Hours):
- [ ] Zero duplicate application links
- [ ] 100% of post-call messages reference call notes
- [ ] Team feedback: "Messages sound way better"
- [ ] Leads reply with context that shows they remember call details

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Rollback Fix #2 (Deduplication):
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
Remove lines 103-120 in call-outcome/route.ts

### Rollback Fix #3 (Contextual Messages):
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
Restore original prompt (lines 123-184) without call notes

---

## Questions to Ask Team:

1. **Greg/Jakub:** "Do Holly's post-call messages sound better now? Do they feel more personal?"

2. **Team:** "Have you seen any duplicate application links in the last 24 hours?"

3. **Team:** "Are leads responding positively to Holly's messages?"

4. **User:** "Should we adjust the 15-minute deduplication window? Make it longer/shorter?"

---

## Known Limitations:

1. **Deduplication only applies to app links:** Other message types (Cal.com links, follow-ups) not deduplicated yet. Can add if needed.

2. **AI quality depends on notes quality:** If advisors write poor notes, Holly can't reference much. Should train team to write detailed notes.

3. **15-minute window is arbitrary:** Might need adjustment based on real usage. Could be 30 minutes or 10 minutes depending on workflow.

---

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy fixes to production
2. Monitor next 5 call outcomes closely
3. Collect team feedback after 48 hours
4. Iterate on AI prompt if messages still not perfect
5. Consider expanding deduplication to other message types
