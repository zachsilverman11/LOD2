# Post-Call Conversion System - Phase 3 Complete

## What We Built

A complete post-call workflow that captures advisor insights and automatically tracks the lead-to-application funnel with weekly performance metrics.

## How It Works

### 1. Call Outcome Capture

After every completed appointment, advisors can click **"Capture Call Outcome"** to record:

- **Outcome Type**: Hot Lead, Needs Follow-up, Not Qualified, or Long Timeline
- **Timeline**: When the lead wants to move forward
- **Notes**: Key conversation points
- **Programs Discussed**: Which mortgage programs were covered
- **Preferred Program**: Lead's top choice

All data is stored and fed directly to Holly for hyper-personalized follow-up.

### 2. Always Editable

- No time limits - capture or edit outcomes anytime
- Edit button on every captured outcome
- Clear button to reset if needed

### 3. Holly's Intelligent Follow-Up

Holly receives ALL captured data and uses it to:

- Reference specific programs discussed
- Mention advisor's notes naturally
- Tailor messaging to timeline and outcome
- Maximize conversion through personalization

### 4. Application Tracking (Finmo Integration)

When leads start or complete their mortgage application:

- System automatically tracks timestamps
- Holly celebrates completed applications
- Holly encourages leads who started but haven't finished
- Full lifecycle visibility from lead → call → application

### 5. Weekly Performance Scorecard

New analytics dashboard tracks 5 critical metrics:

| Metric | Target | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Direct Booking Rate** | 30% | Leads who book appointment immediately via LOD |
| **Holly Response Rate** | 40% | Non-direct leads who reply to Holly's messages |
| **Call-to-App Rate** | 45% | Completed calls that convert to application started |
| **No-Show Rate** | <15% | Scheduled appointments marked no-show |
| **Cohort Performance** | N/A | Monthly breakdown of lead conversions over time |

Each metric shows:
- Current performance vs. target
- Color-coded status (green = hitting target, yellow = close, red = needs work)
- Actual counts behind the percentages

## Where to Find It

- **Capture outcomes**: Pipeline dashboard → Click any lead → Completed appointments
- **View analytics**: Dashboard → Analytics tab → Weekly Performance Scorecard (top of page)
- **Holly's context**: Automatically included in all AI conversations

## Technical Details
