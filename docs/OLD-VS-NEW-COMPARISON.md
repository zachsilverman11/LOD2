# Old System vs New Autonomous Holly: Real Examples

## Test Date: October 17, 2025
## Leads Tested: Mirren Douglas & Robert Grant

---

## Lead 1: Mirren Douglas (Hot Lead - Accepted Offer)

### üìä Situation
- **Status**: CONTACTED
- **Last contact**: 16 hours ago (yesterday 6:53pm)
- **Context**: Has accepted offer on property, subject removal deadline approaching (Sept 27)
- **Key detail**: Already has pre-approval from October 8th with another lender
- **Temperature**: HOT (urgent timeline)
- **Last message from Mirren**: "Oct8*" (clarifying her pre-approval date)

---

### ü§ñ OLD SYSTEM (GPT-4o + Rules)

**What it would do:**
- Follow "Touch #5" rules (this is her 5th message exchange)
- Wait 6-12 hours based on time-since-contact rules
- Send generic follow-up from template library
- Use urgency level "MILD" (days 3-6 in pipeline)

**Expected message:**
```
Hey Mirren! Just wanted to check in - still looking at
that Vancouver property? Reserved rates are filling up.
Want to lock yours in?

https://cal.com/team/inspired-mortgage/...
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Ignores that she ALREADY has pre-approval
- ‚ùå Doesn't address her actual situation
- ‚ùå Sounds like a generic bot follow-up
- ‚ùå Misses the competitive angle
- ‚ùå Doesn't create value (just pushes booking)

---

### ‚ú® NEW SYSTEM (Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Intelligence)

**What Holly decided:**
- **Action**: Send SMS
- **Confidence**: Medium (honest - she's already working with someone)
- **Reasoning**: "She has accepted offer with subject removal approaching, but already pre-approved elsewhere. Recent call went to voicemail. She clarified her situation but hasn't engaged with booking. Critical timing - need to create urgency around rate comparison without being pushy since she's already working with someone."

**Actual message Holly would send:**
```
Got it! Since you're already pre-approved, the main thing
is making sure you lock in the best rate before your
subject removal. Rates can vary by 0.20%+ between
lenders‚Äîon $637K that's real money. Greg can do a quick
rate check against what you have (10 mins). Worth it
before you're locked in?
```

**Why it's better:**
- ‚úÖ Acknowledges her pre-approval (shows Holly listened)
- ‚úÖ Creates specific value ("rate check", quantifies savings)
- ‚úÖ Addresses her ACTUAL concern (already has approval, why talk to us?)
- ‚úÖ Urgency tied to her timeline (subject removal)
- ‚úÖ Low commitment ask ("10 mins" vs generic "book a call")
- ‚úÖ Sounds like a human sales rep who read her file

## Lead 2: Robert Grant (Warm Lead - Renewal Shopping)

### üìä Situation
- **Status**: CONTACTED
- **Last contact**: 23 hours ago (yesterday 11:38am)
- **Context**: Mortgage renewal, looking for options
- **Key detail**: He corrected us - it's a RENEWAL not a refinance
- **Temperature**: WARM (engaged but not urgent)
- **Last message from Robert**: "Hi Holly, It is a mortgage renewal and I'm looking for options."

---

### ü§ñ OLD SYSTEM (GPT-4o + Rules)

**What it would do:**
- See he replied - mark as "ENGAGED"
- Wait based on reply frequency rules
- Follow "Touch #4" template
- Generic qualification question

**Expected message:**
```
Thanks for clarifying, Robert! Our Reserved Ultra-Low
Rates program is perfect for renewals. When's a good
time for a quick call with Greg to see what you qualify
for?

https://cal.com/team/inspired-mortgage/...
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Already sent booking link 23h ago (repetitive)
- ‚ùå Doesn't acknowledge he just corrected us
- ‚ùå Generic pitch doesn't address renewal-specific value
- ‚ùå No diagnostic question to understand his situation
- ‚ùå Pushing for call when he might need more info first

---

### ‚ú® NEW SYSTEM (Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Intelligence)

**What Holly decided:**
- **Action**: Send SMS
- **Confidence**: Medium (acknowledged he may be comparing options)
- **Reasoning**: "Robert clarified it's a renewal (not refinance) and confirmed looking for options. I sent booking link 23h ago but no response - he may be busy, comparing options, or the call feels like too big a commitment. A top rep would acknowledge his clarification, reduce friction by offering something lighter than a full call, and create urgency around renewal timing."

**Actual message Holly would send:**
```
Perfect - renewals are actually our specialty! Most clients
save $200-400/month when they shop around vs auto-renewing.
Quick question: when does your current term end? That'll
help Greg prioritize your rate hold.
```

**Why it's better:**
- ‚úÖ Acknowledges correction ("Perfect - renewals are our specialty")
- ‚úÖ Creates specific value ($200-400/month savings)
- ‚úÖ Asks diagnostic question (when does term end?)
- ‚úÖ Doesn't push booking link again (he already has it)
- ‚úÖ Advances conversation naturally
- ‚úÖ Creates urgency around HIS timeline (term end date)
