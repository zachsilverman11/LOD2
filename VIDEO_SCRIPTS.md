## Video #1: Guaranteed Approvals Certificate (2:30)

### Script for Greg or Jakub:

**[Opening - 0:00-0:15]**
*Camera on, warm smile*

"Hey! I'm Greg with Inspired Mortgage. Holly mentioned you're interested in our Guaranteed Approvals Certificate, so I wanted to jump on here and show you exactly what it is and how it works."

**[Transition to Screen Share - 0:15-0:20]**
*Share screen showing example certificate*

"Let me share my screen so you can see what one of these actually looks like..."

**[Main Content - 0:20-1:30]**

**Show Certificate on Screen:**

"So this is a Guaranteed Approvals Certificate. Think of it like a letter from us that says 'This buyer is 100% approved for their mortgage - guaranteed.'

Here's the problem it solves: You're out there looking at homes, you find one you love, but so do three other buyers. The seller has multiple offers to choose from. Who do you think they're going to pick?

*[Pause for effect]*

The buyer with a Guaranteed Approvals Certificate. Because this tells them you're the real deal - not someone who MIGHT get approved, but someone who's ALREADY approved and ready to close.

**[Click to highlight key sections of certificate]**

Here's what makes it powerful:

1. **We verify everything upfront** - Your income, credit, down payment - all checked and confirmed by us before you even make an offer.

2. **It's underwriter-reviewed** - This isn't just a pre-approval. We've had our underwriting team look at your file and give the thumbs up.

3. **Sellers love it** - In a multiple offer situation, this puts you on the same playing field as a cash buyer. Realtors know when they see this certificate, the deal is going to close.

**[Real Example - 1:30-2:00]**

I'll give you a real example: Last month, we had a client - young couple, first-time buyers - they were competing against four other offers on a townhouse in Burnaby. Three offers were higher than theirs. But they had the Certificate.

The seller picked them. Why? Because the seller knew with 100% certainty the deal would close. No financing falling through, no surprises.

That's the power of this thing.

**[Call to Action - 2:00-2:30]**

Now, here's the thing - not everyone qualifies for this. We need to verify your full situation first.

If you want to see if you qualify and how it would work for your specific purchase, let's jump on a quick 15-minute call. I'll walk you through exactly what we need, how fast we can get it done, and what it'll do for your offer strength.

**[Show Cal.com link on screen]**

Just click the booking link Holly sent you - or if you don't have it handy, it's right here on the screen:

Pick a time that works for you, and we'll get you set up.

Looking forward to chatting!

## Video #2: No Bank Penalties Program (2:45)

### Script for Greg or Jakub:

**[Opening - 0:00-0:20]**
*Camera on, empathetic tone*

"Hey, it's Jakub from Inspired Mortgage. Holly told me you're looking at refinancing, and you mentioned you might be locked into your current mortgage. I want to walk you through our No Bank Penalties Program because it's designed exactly for your situation."

**[Transition to Screen Share - 0:20-0:30]**
*Share screen showing simple calculation spreadsheet*

"Let me show you how this works with some real numbers..."

**[The Problem - 0:30-1:15]**

**[Show penalty calculation on screen]**

"Here's the situation most people are in: They want to refinance - maybe pull out some equity, or get a better rate - but their bank says 'Sure, you can break your mortgage... that'll be $18,000 in penalties.'

*[Let that sink in]*

And here's the kicker - most people don't even know how their bank calculates that penalty. It's this thing called the Interest Rate Differential, or IRD for short. It's complicated, it's expensive, and it's designed to keep you locked in.

**[Show example calculation]**

Here's a real example: $400K mortgage, 2.5 years left on a 5-year term, rates dropped since you signed...

Your penalty could be **$15,000-$25,000** depending on your lender.

That's a massive barrier to accessing your own equity or getting a better deal.

**[The Solution - 1:15-2:15]**

**[Show comparison chart]**

This is where our No Bank Penalties Program comes in.

We work with specific lenders who have **fair penalty structures** - usually just 3 months interest. So instead of $18,000, you're looking at $2,500-$3,000.

But here's the really smart part: We can actually **build that penalty into your new mortgage**.

*[Show the math on screen]*

Let's say you want to refinance to:
- Access $50K in equity
- Lower your payment
- Or consolidate some debt

If your penalty is $3,000, we add that to your new mortgage amount. You don't pay anything out of pocket.

**[Real Example - 2:15-2:30]**

We just helped a couple in Richmond do exactly this. They were with one of the big banks, wanted to pull out $60K for a renovation. Bank said the penalty would be $19,000.

We moved them to one of our fair-penalty lenders, the penalty was $3,200, we built it into the new mortgage, and they walked away with their $60K. Done in 3 weeks.

**[Call to Action - 2:30-2:45]**

Now, here's what I need to do for you: I need to look at your current mortgage - who you're with, your rate, how much time is left - and I can tell you exactly what your penalty would be, and whether this program makes sense.

**[Show Cal.com link]**

Let's hop on a 15-minute call. Bring your last mortgage statement if you have it, and I'll run the numbers right there with you.

## Video #3: Reserved Ultra-Low Rates (2:15)

### Script for Greg or Jakub:

**[Opening - 0:00-0:15]**
*Camera on, confident tone*

"Hey! Greg here from Inspired Mortgage. Holly mentioned you asked about our Reserved Rates program. Let me explain how this works and why it's something you should absolutely take advantage of right now."

**[Transition to Screen Share - 0:15-0:25]**
*Share screen showing rate comparison chart (no specific rates, just visual)*

"Let me show you what I'm talking about..."

**[The Problem - 0:25-0:50]**

"Here's what most people do when they're shopping for a mortgage: They wait until they've found a house, then they start calling banks to see what rate they can get.

The problem? Rates change. Daily.

You find your dream home, you're ready to buy, and boom - rates just went up 0.25%. On a $600K mortgage, that's an extra $90/month for the entire term.

That's over $5,000 over 5 years because you waited.

**[The Solution - 0:50-1:40]**

**[Show rate hold visual]**

This is why we have the Reserved Rates program.

Here's how it works:

**1. We lock in a rate for you TODAY** - even if you haven't found a property yet.

**2. The hold is good for 120-180 days** - depending on the lender. That gives you 4-6 months to find your home.

**3. If rates go DOWN, you get the lower rate** - You're protected on the upside, but you benefit from the downside. It's a win-win.

**4. No cost, no obligation** - There's zero cost to hold the rate. If you don't end up buying, nothing lost.

**[Show example scenario on screen]**

Real scenario from last fall:

Client locked in a rate in September. Rates jumped 0.4% by November when they found their house. They saved that full 0.4% because they had reserved their rate.

On their $700K mortgage, that saved them **$175/month**. Over 5 years, that's **$10,500** in their pocket.

**[Why This Matters Now - 1:40-1:55]**

Here's why I'm telling you to do this NOW:

Rates are unpredictable. They could stay flat, they could drop, they could spike. Nobody knows.

But by reserving a rate, you're protecting yourself from the upside risk while keeping the benefit if they drop.

It's literally free insurance.

**[Call to Action - 1:55-2:15]**

So here's what we should do:

Let's get on a quick 15-minute call. I'll pull today's best rates for your scenario - whether you're buying or refinancing - and we'll lock one in for you.

**[Show Cal.com link]**

Then you can go house hunting knowing exactly what your payment will be. No surprises.
