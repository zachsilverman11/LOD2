## 🎯 4 Core KPIs (Monitor Daily)

### 1. Lead-to-Call Rate ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
- **Formula:** (Calls Scheduled ÷ Total Leads) × 100
- **Target:** 18%
- **Color Coding:**
  - 🟢 Green: ≥18% (hitting target)
  - 🟡 Yellow: 14-17.9% (approaching target)
  - 🔴 Red: <14% (needs improvement)

**What it means:** Out of 100 leads, you should book 15-20 discovery calls. This measures Holly's effectiveness at converting leads to bookings.

---

### 2. Response Rate
- **Formula:** (Leads Who Replied ÷ Total Leads) × 100
- **Target:** 35%
- **Color Coding:**
  - 🟢 Green: ≥35%
  - 🟡 Yellow: 28-34.9%
  - 🔴 Red: <28%

**What it means:** Percentage of leads who reply to Holly's first contact. Indicates engagement quality. Industry average for mortgage SMS: 30-40%.

---

### 3. Show-Up Rate
- **Formula:** (Calls Completed ÷ Calls Scheduled) × 100
- **Target:** 75%
- **Color Coding:**
  - 🟢 Green: ≥75%
  - 🟡 Yellow: 60-74.9%
  - 🔴 Red: <60%

**What it means:** Percentage of scheduled calls that actually happen. If below 70%, improve confirmation/reminder system.

---

### 4. Lead-to-App Rate ⭐ REVENUE INDICATOR
- **Formula:** (Applications/Deals ÷ Total Leads) × 100
- **Target:** 6%
- **Color Coding:**
  - 🟢 Green: ≥6%
  - 🟡 Yellow: 4.8-5.9%
  - 🔴 Red: <4.8%

**What it means:** Your money metric. Out of 100 leads, 6-7 should submit applications or close deals. This is your north star.

## 📈 Supporting Metrics

### 5. Call-to-App Rate
- **Target:** 45%
- **What it measures:** Greg/Jakub's close rate on discovery calls
- **Formula:** (Applications ÷ Calls Completed) × 100

### 6. Average Time to Reply
- **Target:** <24 hours
- **What it measures:** How fast leads respond (faster = hotter leads)

### 7. Total Pipeline Value
- **What it measures:** Sum of all active lead loan amounts ($CAD)
- **Use for:** Forecasting potential revenue

### 8. Total Leads
- **What it measures:** Volume from Leads on Demand
- **Track:** Active vs Converted vs Lost

---

## 🎯 Realistic Targets for 100 Leads/Month

### Industry Context
Leads on Demand provides **high-intent leads** - not just name/email captures. These leads filled out:
- Loan amount
- Purchase price or property value
- Down payment
- Credit score
- Property type
- Timeline

This is **mid-funnel**, not top-of-funnel.

### Conservative Targets (Month 1)

| Metric | Target | Expected Count |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Total Leads** | 100 | 100 leads |
| **Response Rate** | 35% | 35 leads reply |
| **Lead-to-Call Rate** | 18% | 18 calls booked |
| **Show-Up Rate** | 75% | 13-14 calls completed |
| **Call-to-App Rate** | 45% | 6-7 applications |
| **Lead-to-App Rate** | 6-7% | **6-7 apps total** |

### Aggressive Targets (Months 2-3)

| Metric | Target | Expected Count |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Response Rate** | 40% | 40 leads reply |
| **Lead-to-Call Rate** | 22% | 22 calls booked |
| **Show-Up Rate** | 80% | 17-18 calls completed |
| **Call-to-App Rate** | 50% | 8-10 applications |
| **Lead-to-App Rate** | 8-10% | **8-10 apps total** |

## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Month 1 (Conservative - 100 Leads)

**Assumptions:**
- 6-7 applications submitted
- 50-60% app-to-close rate
- Average mortgage: $600K
- Average commission: 1% = $6,000/deal

**Calculation:**
- 7 applications × 55% close rate = **~4 deals**
- 4 deals × $6,000 = **$24,000 revenue**
- LOD cost: $40/lead × 100 = **$4,000 cost**
- **Net profit: $20,000 (500% ROI)**

### Month 3 (Aggressive - 100 Leads)

**With optimized system:**
- 10 applications × 60% close rate = **~6 deals**
- 6 deals × $6,000 = **$36,000 revenue**
- LOD cost: **$4,000**
- **Net profit: $32,000 (800% ROI)**
