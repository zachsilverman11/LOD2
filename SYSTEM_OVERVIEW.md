## üìä How It Works: Lead Journey

### 1. **Lead Capture** (Webhook Integration)
```
Leads on Demand ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Database ‚Üí AI Activation
```

When a lead comes in from Leads on Demand:
- Lead details stored in database (name, email, phone, loan type, property details, credit score)
- Slack notification sent to team channel
- AI immediately analyzes lead profile and sends first contact message
- Status set to "NEW"

**Example Lead Data Captured:**
- Name: Sarah Martinez
- Phone: +17789876543
- Email: sarah@example.com
- Loan Type: Purchase ($750K home, $200K down, 760 credit score)
- Location: Vancouver, BC
- Property Type: Single Family Home

### 2. **AI-Powered First Contact** (Within minutes)

Holly (AI) sends personalized SMS based on lead profile:

**For Purchase Leads:**
```
Hey Sarah! üëã Zach sent over your details about the $750K home
purchase in Vancouver. I'm Holly with Inspired Mortgage.

Quick question - are you working with a realtor yet, or still
exploring? We've got Guaranteed Approvals Certificates that can
give you a big edge in competitive offers üè°

What's your timeline looking like?
```

**For Refinance Leads:**
```
Hi Michael! Zach passed along your info about refinancing your
Burnaby property. I'm Holly with Inspired Mortgage.

I see you're looking to access some equity - our No Bank Penalties
Program might be perfect timing for you.

Are you locked in with your current lender, or is your renewal
coming up soon?
```

**Status automatically updates: NEW ‚Üí CONTACTED**

### 3. **Intelligent Conversation Management**

Holly continues the conversation with context awareness:

- **Tracks conversation history**: Knows what was discussed previously
- **Adapts messaging strategy**: Changes tone/approach based on engagement
- **Pipeline intelligence**: Adjusts based on how many messages sent, days since contact, reply rate
- **Program positioning**:
  - Purchase ‚Üí Guaranteed Approvals Certificate
  - Refinance ‚Üí No Bank Penalties Program
  - All leads ‚Üí Reserved Ultra-Low Rates

**Example Multi-Turn Conversation:**
```
Lead: "We're looking to move in the next 3-4 months"

Holly: "Perfect timing! 3-4 months gives us room to get you fully
pre-approved and positioned strong.

With your $200K down and 760 credit score, you're in great shape.
Our Guaranteed Approvals Certificate basically means sellers know
you're the real deal üí™

Want to jump on a quick 15-min call with Greg or Jakub this week?
They can walk you through exactly what you qualify for and lock
in those reserved rates."

Lead: "Sure, what times work?"

Holly: [Sends Cal.com booking link with pre-filled details]
"Here's our calendar - pick whatever works best for you!
https://cal.com/inspired-mortgage?name=Sarah+Martinez&email=...&phone=+17789876543"
```

**Status updates: CONTACTED ‚Üí ENGAGED ‚Üí CALL_SCHEDULED**

### 4. **Automated Booking Process**

When lead is ready to book:
- AI sends Cal.com link with **pre-filled** name, email, and phone (+1 country code)
- Lead just picks a time slot
- Appointment syncs to Greg/Jakub's calendar
- Confirmation emails sent automatically
- Lead status: CALL_SCHEDULED

### 5. **Appointment Lifecycle** üÜï (Fully Automated)

**After booking:**
- ‚úÖ Holly sends immediate confirmation message
- ‚úÖ 24h reminder automated
- ‚úÖ 1h reminder automated

**If lead reschedules:**
- ‚úÖ Appointment time updated automatically
- ‚úÖ Holly sends new time confirmation
- ‚úÖ Reminders reset to new time

**If lead cancels:**
- ‚úÖ Appointment marked as cancelled
- ‚úÖ Holly sends recovery message: "Want to find a new time?"
- ‚úÖ Lead moves back to booking mode

**After call time (1 hour later):**
- ‚úÖ System auto-marks appointment as completed
- ‚úÖ Lead status ‚Üí CALL_COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Slack notification: "Did call happen? Mark as no-show if needed"
- ‚úÖ Post-call follow-up queued for 1 hour later

**If no-show:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only manual action:** Click "Mark as No-Show" button in dashboard
- ‚úÖ Holly sends recovery message
- ‚úÖ Lead moves back to ENGAGED

**Result:** 90-95% of appointments handled with zero manual work. Only action needed: marking no-shows.

### 6. **60-Day Follow-Up Sequence**

For leads who don't respond immediately:
- **Day 1**: Initial personalized SMS
- **Day 3**: Follow-up with different angle
- **Day 7**: Value-add message (program explanation)
- **Day 14**: Channel switch attempt (try email if only using SMS)
- **Day 30**: Long-term nurture touch
- **Day 60**: Final re-engagement attempt

AI adjusts strategy based on:
- Reply rate (if they've never replied, changes approach)
- Pipeline stage (different messaging for ENGAGED vs NURTURING)
- Loan type (purchase urgency vs refinance flexibility)
