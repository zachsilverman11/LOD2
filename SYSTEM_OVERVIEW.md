## üîÑ How It Works: Complete Lead Journey

### 1. **Lead Capture** (Webhook Integration)
```
Leads on Demand ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Database ‚Üí AI Activation
```

When a lead comes in from Leads on Demand:
- Lead details stored in database (name, email, phone, loan type, property details, credit score)
- Slack notification sent to team channel
- AI immediately analyzes lead profile and sends first contact message
- Status set to "NEW"

**Example Lead Data Captured:**
- Name: Sarah Martinez
- Phone: +17789876543
- Email: sarah@example.com
- Loan Type: Purchase ($750K home, $200K down, 760 credit score)
- Location: Vancouver, BC
- Property Type: Single Family Home

### 2. **AI-Powered First Contact** (Within minutes)

Holly (AI) sends personalized SMS based on lead profile:

**For Purchase Leads:**
```
Hey Sarah! Just got your details about the $750K home purchase in
Vancouver. I'm Holly with Inspired Mortgage.

Quick question - are you working with a realtor yet, or still
exploring? We've got Guaranteed Approvals Certificates that can
give you a big edge in competitive offers.

What's your timeline looking like?
```

**For Refinance Leads:**
```
Hi Michael! Got your info about refinancing your Burnaby property.
I'm Holly with Inspired Mortgage.

I see you're looking to access some equity - our No Bank Penalties
Program might be perfect timing for you.

Are you locked in with your current lender, or is your renewal
coming up soon?
```

**Status automatically updates: NEW ‚Üí CONTACTED**

### 3. **Intelligent Conversation Management**

Holly continues the conversation with context awareness:

- **Tracks conversation history**: Knows what was discussed previously
- **Adapts messaging strategy**: Changes tone/approach based on engagement
- **Pipeline intelligence**: Adjusts based on how many messages sent, days since contact, reply rate
- **Channel-aware**: Acknowledges if lead switches between SMS and email
- **Anti-repetition**: Never sends the same message twice, varies programs and angles
- **Program positioning**:
  - Purchase ‚Üí Guaranteed Approvals Certificate
  - Refinance ‚Üí No Bank Penalties Program
  - All leads ‚Üí Reserved Ultra-Low Rates

**Example Multi-Turn Conversation:**
```
Lead: "We're looking to move in the next 3-4 months"

Holly: "Perfect timing! 3-4 months gives us room to get you fully
pre-approved and positioned strong.

With your $200K down and 760 credit score, you're in great shape.
Our Guaranteed Approvals Certificate basically means sellers know
you're the real deal.

Want to jump on a quick 15-min call with Greg or Jakub this week?
They can walk you through exactly what you qualify for and lock
in those reserved rates."

Lead: "Sure, what times work?"

Holly: [Sends Cal.com booking link with pre-filled details]
"Here's our calendar - pick whatever works best for you!
https://cal.com/inspired-mortgage?name=Sarah+Martinez&email=...&phone=+17789876543"
```

**Status updates: CONTACTED ‚Üí ENGAGED ‚Üí CALL_SCHEDULED**

### 4. **Strategic Follow-Up System** üÜï (Anti-Spam Safeguards)

For leads who don't respond immediately, Holly uses a **strategic** (not aggressive) sequence:

**CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS:**
- ‚úÖ **4-hour minimum gap** between ANY automated messages
- ‚úÖ **Skips leads with upcoming appointments** (handled separately)
- ‚úÖ **Stops if lead replies** (switches to contextual conversation)

**First Week Schedule:**
- **Day 1, +6h**: One follow-up (if no response)
- **Day 2**: One check-in
- **Day 4**: Mid-week touch (skip Day 3)
- **Day 7**: Week-end check

**Weeks 2-4:**
- Week 2 (Days 8-14): Every 2-3 days
- Week 3-4 (Days 15-30): Every 4 days

**Month 2:**
- Days 31-60: Weekly touches

**After 60 Days:**
- No response ever ‚Üí Auto-moved to LOST

**Holly adapts approach each time:**
- Message 1-3: Programs & urgency
- Message 4-6: Questions & qualification
- Message 7-9: Value-add & education
- Message 10+: Soft check-ins, market updates

### 5. **Automated Booking Process**

When lead is ready to book:
- AI sends Cal.com link with **pre-filled** name, email, and phone (+1 country code)
- Lead just picks a time slot
- Appointment syncs to Greg/Jakub's calendar
- Confirmation emails sent automatically
- Lead status: CALL_SCHEDULED
- **Holly switches to "Confirmation Mode"** - no more booking attempts

### 6. **Appointment Lifecycle** (Fully Automated)

**After booking:**
- ‚úÖ Holly sends immediate confirmation message
- ‚úÖ 24h reminder automated (friendly, builds excitement)
- ‚úÖ 1h reminder automated (quick heads up)

**If lead reschedules:**
- ‚úÖ Appointment time updated automatically via Cal.com webhook
- ‚úÖ Holly sends new time confirmation
- ‚úÖ Reminders reset to new time

**If lead cancels:**
- ‚úÖ Appointment marked as cancelled via Cal.com webhook
- ‚úÖ Holly sends recovery message: "Want to find a new time?"
- ‚úÖ Lead moves back to ENGAGED (re-enters booking mode)

**After call time (1 hour later):**
- ‚úÖ System auto-marks appointment as completed
- ‚úÖ Lead status ‚Üí CALL_COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Slack notification: "Did call happen? Capture outcome or mark no-show"

**If no-show:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Click "Mark as No-Show" button in dashboard
- ‚úÖ Holly sends recovery message
- ‚úÖ Lead moves back to ENGAGED

**Result:** 90-95% of appointments handled with zero manual work.

### 7. **Post-Call Outcome Capture** üÜï

**After every discovery call, team captures outcome in dashboard:**

**Outcome Types:**
1. **Hot Lead** - Ready to move forward
   - Holly sends application link immediately
   - 24h/48h follow-ups if app not started
   - References specific programs discussed on call

2. **Needs Follow-Up** - More info needed
   - Holly asks how call went
   - Provides additional information
   - Keeps conversation going based on needs

3. **Not Qualified** - Doesn't fit programs
   - Holly sends warm close message
   - Lead auto-moved to LOST
   - Door left open for future

4. **Long Timeline** - Interested but 3-6+ months out
   - Holly acknowledges their timeline
   - Lead auto-moved to NURTURING
   - Check-ins scheduled based on timeline

**What Gets Captured:**
- Outcome type
- Timeline (if applicable)
- Next step (send_application, schedule_followup, etc.)
- Programs discussed
- Preferred program
- Advisor notes

**Holly uses this context** to send highly personalized post-call messages.

### 8. **Application Tracking** üÜï (Finmo Integration)

  - Loan type and amount
  - Property details
  - Full conversation history (as notes)
  - Source attribution
