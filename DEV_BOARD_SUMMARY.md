## 🎓 How It Works (Technical)

1. **Manual Card Creation:**
   ```
   User clicks "+ New Card" → Form submission → POST /api/dev-cards
   → Create in DB → Send Slack notification → Refresh UI
   ```

2. **AI System Monitoring:**
   ```
   Every 30 min → Vercel cron triggers /api/cron/system-monitor
   → runSystemMonitor() analyzes metrics
   → Creates cards for detected issues
   → Each card includes metadata (impact, evidence, suggestion)
   → Slack notification sent
   ```

3. **Drag & Drop:**
   ```
   User drags card → onDragEnd event → PATCH /api/dev-cards/[id]
   → Update status in DB → If DEPLOYED, set deployedAt timestamp
   → Optimistic UI update
   ```

4. **Comments:**
   ```
   User adds comment → POST /api/dev-cards/[id]/comments
   → Create comment in DB → Refresh modal → Show in thread
   ```
